# Python Tweepy API Script for Automating Tweet Posting

This project is a simple Python script that allows you to post tweets automatically using the [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) library and the Twitter API. It's a great starting point for anyone looking to automate interactions with Twitter via Python.

## Features

- **Post Tweets Programmatically**: Send a tweet by calling a single function.
- **Tweepy Integration**: Utilizes the robust Tweepy library to handle Twitter API interactions.
- **Simple and Lightweight**: Minimal codebase designed for quick integration.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this script, you need the following:

1. **Python 3.x**: Download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Tweepy Library**: Install Tweepy using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install tweepy
Twitter Developer Account: You need to have a Twitter Developer account to create an app and access the API credentials. Sign up here.
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/CodeWithRanjHa/Twitter-X-BOT.git
cd Twitter-X-BOT
2. Get Twitter API Credentials
To interact with the Twitter API, you need to create an application on the Twitter Developer Portal and obtain the following:

API Key
API Secret Key
Access Token
Access Token Secret
Follow these steps:

Go to the Twitter Developer Portal.
Create a new app and generate your API and access tokens.
Copy and store these credentials safely.
3. Configure the Script
Open the script.py file and replace the placeholder strings with your actual Twitter API credentials:

python
Copy code
API_KEY = 'Your API Key here'
API_SECRET_KEY = 'Your Secret Key here'
ACCESS_TOKEN = 'Access Token here'
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = 'Access Token Secret here'
4. Post a Tweet
After you configure the credentials, you can post a tweet by running the script:

bash
Copy code
python script.py
The script will post the following tweet:

python
Copy code
tweet_message = "This is a test tweet using Python!"
Feel free to modify the tweet_message variable in the script to send your custom tweet.

Example Usage
python
Copy code
# Modify this message in the script
tweet_message = "Automating my first tweet using Python and Tweepy!"

# Run the script, and the tweet will be posted automatically
